changes:
  - bugfix: IC grabbers now drop items instead of early-returning when 
      unfiltered
  - tweak: IC adjacent locators now have a second input pin that filters by 
      movable objects when enabled, to be more in line with how they are 
      intended to be used. the original functionality is preserved by just 
      setting this pin to false
delete-after: true
