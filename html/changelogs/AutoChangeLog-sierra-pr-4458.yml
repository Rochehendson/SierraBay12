changes:
  - rscadd: Added physical exam findings for mild and severe allergies; can be 
      detected by stethoscope or grab+examine
  - rscadd: Mild allergies cause wheezing and a mild rash that can be seen on 
      grab+examine by anyone Trained in Medicine
  - rscadd: Severe allergies cause wheezing (if breathing stabilized with 
      inaprov) and a severe rash that can be seen on grab+examine by Basic 
      Medicine skill
  - balance: All other skin physical exam findings (grab+examine) now require 
      Basic medicine skill
  - balance: Inaprov now completely resolves mild allergies after sufficient 
      levels build up. Allergy can re-trigger if inaprov is completely out of 
      blood stream but allergen remains.
