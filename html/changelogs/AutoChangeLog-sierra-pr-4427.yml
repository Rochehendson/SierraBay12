changes:
  - rscadd: The sensors console has been moved to a nano console program. The 
      program requires a ship interface board in order to be able to modify 
      sensors settings.
  - tweak: Navigation consoles and telescreens have also been moved to modular 
      consoles, using the sensors program while lacking the necessary component 
      and access to make changes to the sensor settings.
