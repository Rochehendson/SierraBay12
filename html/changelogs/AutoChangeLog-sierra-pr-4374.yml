changes:
  - tweak: The seed storage UI now has more legible styling and will no longer 
      reset its scroll position when you dispense a seed, as well as staying up 
      to date when someone else interacts with it
  - tweak: NanoUIs now automatically attempt to keep the scroll position after 
      they update
delete-after: true
