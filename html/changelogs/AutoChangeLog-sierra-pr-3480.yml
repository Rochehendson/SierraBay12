changes:
  - {rscadd: 'Corporate Operative now has a dash that can instantly climb ladders,
      get into mechs, and scale objects like tables. The user is invulnerable during
      a dash, and can grab someone if the target is a player.'}
  - {tweak: 'AUGMENT_EYES now exists separately for eye augments like HUDs, glare
      dampeners.'}
  - {bugfix: The Sol operative suit shield now has a 10 second cooldown before you
      can turn it back on after it dies.}
  - {tweak: The shield now takes 1000kw to fill instead of 500kw. It takes the same
      amount of time but will drain your suit cell more than before now.}
  - {tweak: CorpoOp armblades have been merged with esword code. They're now laser
      armblades and do more reliable damage.}
  - {tweak: "CorpoOp dash now automatically attacks a human target if you are holding
      a melee weapon. You still must directly click the target to dash \"at\" them,
      not the turf they're on."}
  - {bugfix: You no longer drop the RIG e-armblade and RIG e-sword due to pain or
      falling over.}
