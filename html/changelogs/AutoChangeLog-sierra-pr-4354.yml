changes:
  - rscadd: Engine control consoles have been turned into a module console 
      program and respective consoles have been replaced accordingly.
  - rscadd: Added new functionality for required components for programs. The 
      engine control console requires a ship interface board installed on 
      consoles for the software to function.
  - rscadd: Added the ship-linked control interface, a computer part that 
      replaces the ship thruster circuit board, keeping it at a similar level of
      difficulty to access the new program. This is intended to prevent the ship
      thrusters from being controlled from any console on the ship.
